BJC and CODE_HS curriculum comaprison

Assignments - Both
BJC and Code HS are web based curriculums. They both have assignments ranging from an introductory level to more complex. Code HS seems to have  more assignments that range from programming exercises to question handouts that can range throughout a school year.

Assessments- Code HS
Code HS offer assessments for pretest, posttest and exams throughout the school year. They also provide a guide on what to look for when grading work.

Gradebook-
CODE HS gives the option of adding students through Google classroom which allows students to see posted assignments. Some assignments can be filter out and edited as well.

Progress-
Students can see their progress through a grade book and keep track on well they are doing on their assignments. In BJC you have to make the assignment in google classroom for the students to see how they are doing.

Handouts-
Both curricula offer exercise handouts but Code Hs handouts are more organized and ready to go. BJC works have to be edited before being shown to students.

Problems guides-
Both curricula offer problem guides and teacher resources to refer to.

Forums-
Both curriculum of forums but CODE HS forums are linked directly on the website for you to access once logged in. BCC has a forum through your email in which people ask questions and offer suggestions.

Glossary- Both have a glossary of vocabulary terms to review in each chapter.

Create a playlist-
CODE HS offers a playlist curriculum you can click on what you want students to do automatically. BJC you have to organize a google classroom and be specific on what they must do.

Course catalog-
CODE HS has a catalog of various courses as well as two different versions of a programming language offering more variety.

Certification exams-
CodeHS offers a certification examination for students.

Summary-
CODE HS curriculum is much more applicable, advanced and detailed to fill an entire school year. I have just started using the program this year and have been impressed by what they have to offer in detail. Anything that BJC has to offer CODE HS does as well and in my opinion a much better job. When I was teaching with BJC I had to supplement the material and look toward other resources such as Khan Academy and  Albert IO.
